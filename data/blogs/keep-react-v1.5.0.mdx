## Release Notes

Welcome to the latest release of Keep React! This version brings numerous improvements and updates to our components while preserving the familiar UI look and feel.

## Animation

We are excited to announce that we are now using the highly popular animation framework, `Framer Motion`, in our components such as Tabs, Modal, and Notification. This will enhance the user experience with smooth and engaging animations.

## Features

- Keep Presets Removed: We have streamlined our package by removing Keep Presets.
- Import cn() Function: You can now import the cn() function directly from keep-react for better convenience.
- Customizable Colors Theme: You can now customize the color themes according to your project requirements.
- Avatar Structure Update: The Avatar component structure has been updated for better performance and flexibility.
- Checkbox, Switch, Slider: These components now utilize @radix-ui, ensuring better accessibility and usability.
- asChild Prop Available: The asChild prop is now available, allowing greater control over component rendering.
- KeepPortal: You can use KeepPortal to create your own Portal easily.

## Installation Process

We have simplified the integration process. You can now import `keepTheme` from `keep-react/keepTheme` to achieve the same functionality. For more details, please check out the installation docs [`here`](docs/getting-started/introduction).

```tsx {1,8} showLineNumbers
import { keepTheme } from 'keep-react/keepTheme'

const config = {
  content: ['./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}'],
  theme: {},
}

export default keepTheme(config)
```
